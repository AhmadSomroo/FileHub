# FileHub
A python based secure File Web-Based File Sharing App
In the project, the app runs on port 5000 with Apache2.0 server as reverse proxy between client and app.
Although every vulnerability was addressed to best possible way but, 
the app might still be vulnerable to CSRF as some security testing utilities gave only CSRF vulnerability in this App.
